## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Backtrader

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy backtrader

Setup Instructions
Download the CSV Data: Obtain historical options data in CSV format. The code expects the data to be structured with specific columns including datetime, expiry_date, date, open, high, low, close, iv, and delta.

Place the Data File: Save the downloaded CSV file (e.g., FINNIFTY01AUG2320300PE.csv) in the same directory as the script.

Adjust File Path: If necessary, modify the file path in the code where the CSV is loaded.

How to Run the Code
Ensure your environment is set up as per the Requirements.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.

Run the script using Python:

bash
Copy code
python your_script_name.py
Replace your_script_name.py with the actual name of the Python file.

The script will perform backtesting on the defined strategies and display the results in the terminal.

Strategies Overview
Long Straddle: A strategy that involves buying both a call and put option to profit from high volatility in either direction.
Bull Call Spread: A strategy that involves buying a call option at a lower strike price and selling another call option at a higher strike price.
Protective Put: A strategy that involves holding a long position in an asset while buying a put option to protect against downside risk.
Each strategy has specific parameters that can be adjusted within the code, such as volatility thresholds, profit targets, and stop-loss levels.
